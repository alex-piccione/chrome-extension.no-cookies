# Browser Annoyance Killer

This is a Chrome extension to remove :cookie: settings dialog
...and other annoyances.

It works also in Maxthon, my main browser.

### Websites that we can't fix

| :x: | www.timeanddate.com | Not solved    | Removing the cookies panels seems to breack some functionalities |
